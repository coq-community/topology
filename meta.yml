  ## Contents

  In alphabetical order, except where related files are grouped together:

  - `Cardinals.v` - cardinalities of sets
  - `Ordinals.v` - a construction of the ordinals without reference to well-orders

  - `Classical_Wf.v` - proofs of the classical equivalence of wellfoundedness, the minimal element property, and the descending sequence property

  - `CSB.v` - the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem

  - `DecidableDec.v` - `classic_dec: forall P: Prop, {P} + {~P}.`

  - `DependentTypeChoice.v` - choice on a relation (`forall a: A, B a -> Prop`)

  - `EnsemblesImplicit.v` - settings for appropriate implicit parameters for the standard library's Ensembles functions
  - `ImageImplicit.v` - same for the standard library's Sets/Image
  - `Relation_Definitions_Implicit.v` - same for the standard library's Relation_Definitions

  - `EnsemblesSpec.v` - defines a notation for e.g. `[ n: nat | n > 5 /\ even n ] : Ensemble nat.`

  - `EnsemblesUtf8.v` - optional UTF-8 notations for set operations

  - `Families.v` - operations on families of subsets of `X`, i.e. `Ensemble (Ensemble X)`
  - `IndexedFamilies.v` - same for indexed families `A -> Ensemble X`

  - `FiniteIntersections.v` - defines the finite intersections of a family of subsets

  - `FiniteTypes.v` - definitions and results about finite types
  - `CountableTypes.v` - same for countable types
  - `InfiniteTypes.v` - same for infinite types

  - `FunctionProperties.v` - injective, surjective, etc.

  - `InverseImage.v` - inverse images of subsets under functions

  - `Proj1SigInjective.v` - inclusion of `{ x: X | P x }` into `X` is injective

  - `Quotients.v` - quotients by equivalence relations, and induced functions on them

  - `WellOrders.v` - some basic properties of well-orders, including a proof that Zorn's Lemma implies the well-ordering principle

  - `ZornsLemma.v` - proof that choice implies Zorn's Lemma
